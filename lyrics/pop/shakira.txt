[Intro: Wyclef Jean]
Ladies up in here tonight
No fightin' (We got the refugees up in here)
No fightin'
No fightin'
Shakira, Shakira

[Pre-Chorus: Wyclef Jean & Shakira]
I never really knew that she could dance like this (Hey)
She make a man wanna speak Spanish
¿Cómo se llama? (¡Sí!), ¿bonita? (¡Sí!)
Mi casa (Shakira, Shakira), su casa
Oh, baby, when you talk like that (Huh-uh; yeah)
You make a woman go mad (Oh)
So be wise (¡Sí!), and keep on (¡Sí!)
Reading the signs of my body (Uno, dos, tres, cuatro)
No fightin'

[Chorus: Shakira & Wyclef Jean]
I'm on tonight
You know my hips don't lie (No fighting)
And I'm starting to feel it's right
All the attraction, the tension
Don't you see, baby? This is perfection

[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean]
Hey, girl, I can see your body moving
And it's driving me crazy (Huh-uh)
And I didn't have the slightest idea
Until I saw you dancin' (Yeah)
And when you walk up on the dance floor, nobody cannot ignore
The way you move your body, girl (Just smooth)
And everything's so unexpected, the way you right and left it
So you can keep on shakin' it (Let's go)
